# Breakdown

There are a series of rules that define which bags in a list can be contained by which other bags. The list is comprised of lowercase descriptions, beginning with a color (meaning, all bags of said color) and followed by which other color bags can it contain, if any. Eventually, the idea is to find how many bags can contain at least one "shiny golden bag", based on the bags inside of them, like matryoshka dolls, based on the contents that one bag can hold, and the contents that the held bag can hold, recursively.

## Strategy

Due to the structured nature of the data, it is possible to create regular expressions that capture as many possible groups. I may be able to split a singular string into a container bag which is the head of a list item, and then append a list in a second dimension for the contained bags respective to that item. The number of bags does not matter, just the color of the bag within the container bag. I could also make a check to only add new entries to the list of colors, to avoid blowing up the 2D array with repeats. If a bag color for container already exists, simply append the contained bags to the list. If the contained bags already exist, then skip them. Afterwards, I could probably check both dimensions and add up which bags can eventually contain a gold bag themselves, or within the bags they contain. I could probably make a "contained by" dictionary that uses the color of the bag as a key and True as a value, to avoid duplicates and be able to count the total of keys for a total of container bags that can hold a gold one.
